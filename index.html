  <h1>Welcome to The Student Mobilization Community!</h1>

    <p>
      The Student Mobilization Community is a Cleveland Institute of Art student
      organization dedicated to educating campus community members and making
      active change towards the world they want to see. The overarching theme of
      SMC will be incorporating global liberation and activist calisthenics into
      students' everyday lives. We will do this through organizing and partaking
      in events that strengthen the CIA community and beyond. Activities of the
      organization will include teach-ins, speakers, collective community
      action, volunteering, and discussions of not only the world we want to
      see, but how we make it a reality.
